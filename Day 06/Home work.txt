1. Take integer inputs a, b, and
    a. If a is greater than 100 and b is greater than 10, then print “a is above 100
       and b is above 10”
    b. If a is greater than 50 and b is greater than 50, then print “a is above 50 and
    b is above 50”
    c. If a is greater than 20 and b is greater than 100, then print “a is above 20
       and b is above 100”
    d. If none of the above condition follows then print “None”

2. Take height, weight and age of a person as an integer input and follow these
conditions below in the stepwise manner, which is if the condition given before
fails only then move on to the next condition, otherwise don’t
    a. If height is equal to 5 and weight is equal to 50 and age is equal to 10, then print “Overweight”
    b. If height is equal to 5 or weight is equal to 60, then print “Fat”
    c. If height is equal to 6 and weight is equal to 50, then print “Slim”
    d. If none of the condition follows, then print “None”
