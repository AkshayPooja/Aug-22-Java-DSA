1. Take an integer input.
    If the entered number is an even number, then
        a. If the number is greater than 1000, then print “Even and above 1000”
        b. Else print “Even”
    Else If the entered number is an odd number, then
        a. If the number is greater than 1000, then print “Odd and above 1000”
        b. Else print “Odd”

2. Take integer inputs x, y, z from the user,
    If the x is divisible by 3, then
        a. If y is greater than or equal to 200, then add 10 to the value of z.
        b. Else if y is greater than or equal to 100 but less than 200, then add 5 to the
           value of z
        c. Else if y is greater than or equal to 50, but less than 100, then add 4 to the
           value of z
        d. Else add 1 to z
    Else if x is not divisible by 3, then
        a. If y is greater than or equal to 200, then add 3 to the value of z.
        b. Else if y is greater than or equal to 100 but less than 200, then add 2 to the
           value of z
        c. Else add 1 to z
In the end add 10 to the value of z and print the final value of z.
